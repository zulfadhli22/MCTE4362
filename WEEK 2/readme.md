#CONTROLLER
##1.Microcontroller
A Central Processing Unit (CPU) with program-loading capabilities. Also has Random-Access Memory (RAM) to store variables as well as input and output devices to facilitate communication.
Characteristics:
•	Embedded - microcontroller embeds inside another device. They help control the device’s actions or features.
•	Task-Dedicated - dedicated to do one certain task, designed to run one specific program. As opposed to RAM, this program remains in Read-Only Memory (ROM), where it does not change.
•	Low-Power - only use around 50 milliwatts.
•	Dedicated I/O Device - have a dedicated input device and in most cases, an output device (such as an LCD or LED display). Microcontroller will accept input from the device that it’s controlling and sends signals to other components within it to help control it.
•	Economical and Small - users seek out the smallest and most affordable one that can get the job done.
•	Ruggedized - can withstand high heats and rougher conditions than general purpose computers can handle.
##2.Industrial PC
A robust computer designed to be used in an industrial environment, often involved in the manufacturing of goods.
Characteristics:
•	Fan less and ventless design.
•	Ability to withstand harsh environments.
•	Highly configurable.
•	Extensive I/O options.
•	Long lifecycle.
##3.PLC
A computer specially designed to operate reliably under harsh industrial environments such as extreme temperatures, wet, dry, or dusty conditions.
Characteristics:
•	Integrates the controller with the HMI panel, creating a compact, easy-to-use automation solution. 
•	Users no longer need to establish PLC to panel communications and can program both the Ladder Logic and HMI design in a single software environment. 
•	An all-in-one approach saves time, reduces wiring, and cuts the cost of purchasing multiple devices.
##4.Edge AI Controller
The use of artificial intelligence in the form of machine learning algorithms running directly on edge devices.
Characteristics:
•	Can make predictions, process complex data, and administer solutions.
•	Reduced Latency - no longer a need to transmit data to and from the cloud.
•	Reduced Bandwidth Requirement and Cost - with less data being transmitted to and from edge IoT devices, there will be a lower requirement and thus costs in network bandwidth.
•	Increased Data Security - fewer open connections and fewer opportunities for cyber-attacks.
•	Improved reliability.
